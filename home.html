                <b><u>Football</u></b> is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. 
                Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the 
                word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football 
                (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football 
                or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.
                These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.

                <b><u>Cricket</u></b> is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the 
                centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced 
                on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) 
                the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once 
                they have legally done so six times. The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, with the player 
                at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat.

                <b><u>Hockey</u></b> is a term used to denote various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated 
                on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium.
                There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while 
                others do not. In order to help make the distinction between these 
                various games, the word "hockey" is often preceded by another word i.e. "field hockey", 
                "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink hockey", or "floor hockey".  </p>
