                <b><u>Cricket</u></b> is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the 
                centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced 
                on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) 
                the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once 
                they have legally done so six times. The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, with the player 
                at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat.
